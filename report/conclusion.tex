\section{Conclusion} \sectionauthor{A. Bang, T. B. Nielsen and N. Thykier}
Originally, Jikiban was envisioned to be a merge of ``Chronotron'' and
``Shift''.  ``Shift'' was eventually replaced with ``Sokoban''.
Jikiban was made over several iterations interleaved with playtesting
to achieve the best results.

We replaced unity with PyGame + PGU fairly early in the development
cycle, since the latter was simplier for our purpose.  Playtesting
turned out to be a very important factor in making the game playable.

We made a fun and challenging puzzle game that makes use of 3
dimensions (the third being time).
