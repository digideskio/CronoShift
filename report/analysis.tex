\section{Game analysis}
This section is devoted to an in-depth quality-in-use assessment of
Jikiban, where the basic theory and concepts will be lifted from
several articles taking a scientific approach to game design theory.

\subsection{Playability}
In \cite{sanchez09} the concept ``playability'' is defined as:

\begin{quotation}
The degree to which a specific player achieve specific game goals with
effectiveness, efficiency, flexibility, security and, especially,
satisfaction in a playable context of use.
\end{quotation}

The layout will first delineate the different concepts used and then
proceed to an analysis of how these concepts helped shape and define
Jikiban as an interactive entertainment system.


\subsubsection{Playability theory}
Beyond a broad definition of playability an important dichotomy in
perspective is put forth by R. Hunicke
et. Al. \cite{hunicke01-04}. Namely that the designer has the
diametrically opposite view of the game compared to that of the
player, this dichotomy is illustrated in figure \ref{fig:MDA}.

\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{Mechanics} (M) describes the particular components of the game, at
  the level of data representation and algorithms.
\item \emph{Dynamics} (D) describes the run-time behavior of the mechanics
  acting on player inputs and each others’ outputs over time.
\item \emph{Aesthetics} (A) describes the desirable emotional responses evoked
  in the player, when she interacts with the game system.
\end{itemize}

\figurepng{MDA}{Figure 1: The perspective dichotomy of games.  Source

Thus the impact on the aesthetics and the dynamics of any implemented
rule, mechanic, feature or piece of content must be imagined from the
perspective of a player or assessed though playtesting.

This dichotomy underlines the necessity for player feedback and as
such any game development process should be iterative with playtesting
as a key step, section \ref{player-feedback} will explain our
approach used for playtesting. In addition, this dichotomy obfuscates
the term playability, which now has two distinct meanings.

In \cite{nacke09} these two meanings are referred to as Playability
and Player Experience. In that Playability is the interaction between
the designer and the game, whereas Player Experience is the players
interaction with said game, see figure
\ref{fig:player-xp-vs-playability}.\\

\figurepng{player-xp-vs-playability}{The interfaces between player,
  game and game designer show that playability is directed toward
  evaluating game design, whereas player experience has to be analyzed
  in the player-game interaction process. Source is Nacke
  el. Al. \cite{nacke09}  }


The next 3 sections will explore the different concepts put forth in
figure \ref{fig:MDA} in the context of Jikiban. Starting from the design
perspective different methods for evaluating Playability will be
investigated. Then moving onto a player driven view, which will shed
light on the Player Experience. Lastly the way feedback was used to
shape the game through playtesting is explained.

\section{Player feedback}
\label{player-feedback}
As mentioned previously feedback in this project is gathered solely
through observations during playtesting and subsequent dialog with the
test subjects.

Since playtesting starts early in this prototyping process, early
playtesting was performed using blackboards, paper and the designers
themselves. This part of the process will not be discussed here.  This
section will focus on playtesting performed with subjects unassociated
with the project.  It should be noted that playtesting is not
equivalent to bug testing, all bug testing was done by developers.

% TODO[NT], check the playtesting methods have been described first.
Bugs randomly encountered during playtests are naturally shifted to
bug testing phases.  The playtesting method used during this project
is the method proposed by Sánchez el. Al. \cite{sanchez09} combined
with the method proposed by Portnow et. Al. \cite{portnow}.

Since all test subjects have been adult gamer friends of the
developers, different preventative measures have been applied in order
to minimize inevitable biases. These encompass:

\begin{itemize}
\item Not explaining the game beforehand.
\begin{itemize}
\item This is essential since the game should be self-explanatory.
\end{itemize}

\item Not providing any help other than essential, yet-to-be-implemented features.
\begin{itemize}
\item For example what controls are available.
\end{itemize}

\item Talk to the subject as sparsely as possible.
\item Do not trap the player with social pressure.
\item Do not reject any feedback and do not try to explain. Simply
  listen and note everything.
\begin{itemize}
\item Observe how the subject uses the game, what they naturally want
  to do.
\item Note where they get stuck and what needs better explanation.
\end{itemize}


\item Subjects generally propose solutions rather than pointing out
  problems. These need to be interpreted.
\item Listen carefully for any vocalizations, like a sigh or a
  gasp. If these are noted something was either very right or very
  wrong.
\item Try to note what the subject is looking at, focusing on or
  thinking about. Obviously this data will mostly have to be gathered
  through questions.
\item Use questionnaires and software hooks to gather metrics, like
  goal efficiency, about the game. A host of these metrics are
  proposed here \cite{sanchez09}.
\begin{itemize}
\item These methods were beyond the scope of this project.
\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Playtests}
\label{sec:playtests}

Three iterations of playtests were carried out, with interleaved
design changes to the game. The first of these iterations was
initiated as soon as a working game was up and running. This section
will not go through all individual iterations, but will briefly
outline the most noteworthy findings.  Early playtests showed that
the game was largely unplayable. It should be noted that this early
version had significantly fewer features than the final version. Most
noteworthy

\begin{itemize}
\item Although the levels were solvable, they had never been playtested.
\item There were no hints at all, so the players had no help at all.
\end{itemize}

The players had trouble understanding the concepts of the game such as
how the wait function works in the context of multiple player
copies. Only the active character waits.  However, if the concept of the
past-selves is not well understood, this is not trivial. It becomes
odd that the other past-selves move regardless of what the active
character does. This problem was addressed through a change in the
slope of the learning curve in early levels.

The time machine was the hardest concept to understand. Since the
character was standing on it when entering, it was not apparent that
time had been reset. Now there were simply two versions of the player,
one of which was very hard to control (actually uncontrollable). Both
of these concepts were introduced in level 2 along with buttons and
gates, so the player basically gets overwhelmed early in the game and
gives up.

The player often had problems identifying the active player. There
were nothing to mark which player was actually being moved and the
other past-selves were hidden when standing on the same spot. The
result was that the player's timing was ruined forcing him to restart,
due to a mistake.

The enormous amount of counting required to get through a level often
deterred the players from completing it at all. Often they would find
the trick to the level and then skip it, since the rest was just dull
work. A player described it as having to program the level after
finding the solution. This issue was addressed using patient music,
sound effects on level completion and a score system which encourages
optimization of solutions.

Changes were made to give the player more help in the form of hints,
the hint was displayed below each level. This resulted in a complaint
that the hint was always visible and gave away the solution. On the
bright side the game could now be played to the end, without help, by
experienced gamer. The player would not have played it this much if he
hadn't been asked to though. The game lacked fun and a motivation
factor.

%TODO: align with Evolution part
To accommodate these problems, the hint was hidden behind a button.
Some of the levels were rewritten to incorporate one time buttons and make
a more smooth level progression using these. This enabled the gates
and one-time buttons to be introduced before the ability to go back in
time.
