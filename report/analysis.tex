\section{Analysis}
\subsection{Play-tests}
\paragraph{Early play-tests} showed that the game was largely unplayable. It should be noted that this early version had significantly fewer features than the final version. Most noteworthy:

\begin{lstlisting}
Although the levels were solvable, they had never been playtested before except by the creators.
There were no hints at all, so they users had no help at all.
\end{lstlisting}

The players had trouble understanding the concepts of the game such as how the wait function works. Only the active player waits, but if the concept of the past-selves is not well understood, this is not trivial. It becomes odd that the other past-selves moves regardless of what the active player does. The timemachine was the hardest concept to understand. Since the player was standing on it when entering, it was not apparent that time had been reset. Now there were simply to of the player, one of which was very hard to control (actually uncontrolable). Both of thsese concepts were introduced in level 2 along with buttons and gates, so the user basically gets overwelmed early in the game and gives up.
The user often had problems identifying the active player. There were nothing to mark which player was actually being moved and the other past-selves were hidden when standing on the same spot. The result was that the user's timing was ruined forcing him to restart, due to a mistake.
The enourmous amout of counting required to get through a level often deterred the users from competing it at all. Often they would find the trick to the level and then skip it, since the rest was just  dull work. A user described it as having to program the level after finding the solution.\\

\paragraph{Changes} were made to give the user more help in the form of hint, the hint was displayed below each level. This resulted in a complaint that the hint was always visible and gave away the solution. On the bright side the game could now be played to the end, without help, by and experienced gamer. The user would not have played it this much if he hadn't been asked to though. The game lacked fun and a motivation factor.
To acoomodate these problems the hint was hidden behind a button, and the levels were rewritten to incorporate one time buttons and make a more smooth level progression using these. This enabled the gates and one-time buttons to be introduced before the ability to go back in time.
