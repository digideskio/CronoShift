\section{Introduction}
Jikiban is a 2D turn-based puzzle game based on the two games
Chronotron and Sokoban. Like in Sokoban there are pushable boxes and
the player can be ``cloned'' as in Chronotron.

The goal is to get the coin and return to the time machine in the
least amount of moves.  Often the level is not solvable with just one
player.  Instead the player must rely on his/her ability to jump back
in time to solve the levels.
