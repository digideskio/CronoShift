\section{Introduction}
JikiBan is a game based on the two games Chronotron and Skokoban. Like in Skokoban there are pushable boxes, but instead of only one player, the player can be cloned as in Chronotron. The game is a 2D turnbased puzzle game. The goal is to get the coin and get back to the time machine in the least amount of moves. Often the level is not completeable with just one player, only by creating one or more clones to do some of the work. Unlike Chronotron which is in real time, the turnbased nature of this game gives the player time to think in four dimentions, which makes much more complex levels possible.
