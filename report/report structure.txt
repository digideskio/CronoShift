Introduction [done]
- a short overview of the game, relation to existing games 
 
Detailed Description of the Game
- game rules [done]
- desired features (NT)
	game elements
		teleporters
		shift mechanic
		"Dance evolution" pile (show movements of other clones)
- technical challenges [done]
	synchronization
	non-determanism
	time paradoxes
		how to recognise (e.g. at the curent step is it still possible to somehow reach the time machine?)
	Level design
		is the level solveable and are there trivial/brute force solutions?
			the optimal solution?
			simply fix by scoring games
-emotional engagement of player
	off by one error?!
	primaryly should invoke joy from solving problem and finding a new way of thinking
 
Implementation (Alex)
- technical design including short description of the game's scripts and reasons for choosing this design.
	model-view-controller 
		view-controller er næsten seperaret
		model er fuldstændigt seperaret
			viewet bruger modellen
		controlleren bruger viewet en gang imellem
			controlleren har mulighed for at bede viewet om at highlighte felter (når der peges med musen)
- implementation issues, note any particular technical difficulties and work-arounds.
 	unity problemmer
	sound?


Analysis (Thor, Lørdag aften)
- discuss the playability of the game (prototype? or theoritical game?). (TBN) 
- give a summary of feedback from having a few friends play the game. (TBN)
 
Discussion (NT, needs review)
- discuss the evolution of your game concept from your original pitch to the final version.
	started with shift + chronotron, ended up with sokuban + chronotron
- what would you do differently if you knew at the start what you know now. 

Conclusion

Future work [done]
- what would be your next steps if you were to continue working on the game.
	ditch pygame and PGU?
	implement more desired features
