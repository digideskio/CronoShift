We have considered what to do if we were to do further development
on this game.\\

We strongly considered replacing pygame and PGU.  The problem with
pygame is that even the most basic thing like a ``button'' is
basically ``do-it-yourself''.

While PGU implements many of these basic features, it is still very
annoying to use.  Example, if the text message (label) in a dialog
gets wider than the ``pygame screen'', the application crashes.

If we were to continue with pygame and PGU, we would probably have to
spend some time improving PGU itself.  We have already submitted a few
ideas to the PGU upstream\footnote{Example:
  \url{http://code.google.com/p/pgu/issues/detail?id=33}}

We also have a list of ideas for new fields and game mechanics we
would look at implementing.  There are also quite a few levels that
could use a redesign to make them more interesting and fun to play.
The tutorial has a lot of room for improvement as well.
