\section{Game description}

This section will cover the game representation, its rules, the
(un)implemented features, and the technical challenges of making the
game.

\subsection{Game basics}
The game world is represented as a grid.  Each tile is basically
either a:

\begin{itemize}
\item field - passable, stateless
\item wall - impassable, stateless
\item button - passable, source
\item one time button - passable, source (one-time change)
\item gate - passible/impassable, target
\item one time pass - passable/impassable, self-target (one-time change)
\end{itemize}

There are two special singleton fields, the ``time machine'' and
the ``goal''.  Both fields are passable like a normal field, but
they have special game semantics, which will be covered in the
game rules.

There are two movable elements, namely the player(s) and crates.  The
former are directly controlled by the player and the latter can be
pushed by the player.

Some fields have multiple states and behaviours.  Please refer to
\nameref{field-states} for more information.

A screenshot of graphical representation of the elements is available
in figure~\ref{fig:IconExplanation}.

\paragraph{Game objective}
To complete a given level, the player must obtain the goal (``gold coin''),
return to the time machine and enter it.

\subsection{Player actions}
Each turn, the player can do one of the following moves:

\begin{itemize}
\item Stand still (i.e. ``do nothing'')
\item Attempt to move to a neighbouring square (i.e. up, down, left or right)
\item Enter time machine (only allowed on top of the time-machine)
\end{itemize}

The player can push a crate by moving ``into'' it provided that the
destination for the crate is available.  It is not possible to
``pull'' crates and the player can push at most one crate.  These
are basically the same rules used in Sokoban for moving crates.

\paragraph{Time jumping}
The player has the ability to go back in time to the first turn.  As
the player goes back in time, the world will reset it self to its
initial state, but with one crucial difference.

There is now an extra ``player'' in the level; namely the ``current
self'' that performed the time jump and the ``past self/selves''.  The
latter will carry out their actions (as the player did in that time
jump) and eventually enter the time machine.

All ``selves'' are identically in terms of play rules (e.g. any of
them can pick up the goal).  Particularly, all ``selves'' must
eventually enter the time machine.  The only difference is that the
player actively controls the ``current self''.

Time jumping allows the player to do things that would not otherwise
be possible by playing ``ping-poing'' with his/her ``past selves'',
though at the risk of introducing temporal paradoxes (see
\nameref{temporal-paradox}).

Any number of ``player selves'' are allowed to occupy the same
tile.

\subsubsection{Field states and manipulation}
\label{field-states}
Certain fields in the game world have multiple states with different
behaviour.  State changes are generally triggered by the actions of
the player.  A field can be one of the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item stateless - The field has exactly one state can that will not change.
\item source - When the field is activated, it will trigger other fields.
\item target - The field is triggered via a ``source'' field.
\item self-target - The field is a source field and targets itself.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{source}  Source fields are activated by a player or crate
moving onto the field.  Sources are usually connected to one or more
``targets'', which will then be triggered.  A source field can
generally not target itself (but see ``self-target'' below).  A button
is an example of a source field.

\paragraph{target}  Target fields are fields that are not triggered
by the player (or a crate) entering the field.  Instead it is
connected to one (or more) sources, which can activate or deactivate
it.  A gate is an example of a target field.

\paragraph{self-target}  A self-targetting field is a field that behaves
like a source, but has itself as target (if any target at all).  The
currently only case of this, is the ``one time pass'' field, which is
passable only up to and including the first turn something enters it.
On the very next turn, the ``one time pass'' will become impassable.
If a player (or crate) is on the field at the end of the turn where
the ``one time pass'' becomes impassable the game ends in a loss.

\paragraph{one-time change}  Fields can also have a ``one-time change''
label, which means it can only be triggered ``once'' per time jump.
These will be reset to their initial state at the start of each time
jump.

\subsubsection{Losing}

There are three different ways of losing
\footnote{Implementation Detail: The game calls all cases for a ``Time paradox''.}.

\paragraph{Getting stuck}
If a ``player self'' gets stuck and is unable to return to start, it
is not possible to win.  If the player gets stuck in a closed gate or
a crate, the game will automatically mark the game as lost.

If the player simply manages to ``lock himself/herself into a corner''
with no path back to start, the game will still continue (despite being
unsolvable) until the player restarts/gives up.

\paragraph{Temporal paradox}
\label{temporal-paradox}
As the name suggests, a temporal paradox (``time paradox'') is a bad
thing.  What happens if your current self prevent your past self from
becoming the current self?  In this game, you simply lose.

\paragraph{Non-Determinism}
All valid actions are carried out ``simultaneously''.  If one (or
more) valid action(s) causes another valid action to fail, the result
is non-deterministic.

As an example, consider if two clones attempt to push the same
crate.  This gives 3 cases, of which one is non-deterministic.

\begin{itemize}
\item Both clones pushes it in the same direction (i.e. they perform
  the same action and start on the same field), the actions are
  deterministic and will be carried out.
\item Both clones pushes it in opposite directions.  In this case,
  both actions are ``invalid'' because each clone can conclude (before
  pushing) that the move will not work.  This is deterministic and
  result in none of the clones moving.
\item The clones pushes it in ortogonal directions.  This causes
  non-determinism as each clone believe the action is valid, but
  both actions cannot be carried out.
\end{itemize}

This rule is (also) a generalization of getting stuck in a gate or
crate.

\subsubsection{Scoring}
The player is scored on the number of moves performed and the number
of time jumps used.  For comparsion, the lowest score is considered
best (i.e. most efficient).  The scoring rules are:

\begin{itemize}
\item 1 point per move or skipped turn by the ``current self''.
  Entering the time machine counts as a move.
\item 1 point per skipped turn while the ``current self'' is outside
  the time machine.  0 points if the ``current self'' is inside the
  time machine.
\item 1 point for every time jump performed.
\end{itemize}
