\section{Game description}

This section will cover the game representation, its rules, the
(un)implemented features, and the technical challenges of making the
game.

\subsection{Game basics}
The game world is represented as a grid.  Each tile is basically
either a:

\begin{itemize}
\item Field - passable
\item Wall - impassable
\item Pressure plate (button) - passable
\item ``One-time button'' - passable
\item Gate - state-dependent
\item ``One-time pass'' - state-dependent
\end{itemize}

There are two special singleton fields, the ``time machine'' and
the ``goal''.  Both fields are passable like a normal field, but
they have special game semantics, which will be covered in the
game rules.

There are two movable elements, namely the player and crates.  The
former are directly controlled by the player and the latter can be
pushed by the player.

The game is a single player game, but due to the ``time machine''
there can be more than one ``player self'' present on the game board.
All ``selves'' are identically in terms of play rules (e.g. any of
them can pick up the goal).  Particularly, all ``selves'' must
eventually enter the time machine.  The only difference is that the
player actively controls the ``current self''.

Originially, these ``selves'' were referred to as ``time clones'' (or
simply just ``clones'').  Particularly, in the source code they are
still called ``clones'' and we may use the terms interchangeably.

The action that causes a new ``player self'' to appear is called a
``time jump'' and is explained in detail in \nameref{time-jumping}.

Some fields have multiple states and behaviours.  Please refer to
\nameref{field-states} for more information.

A screenshot of graphical representation of the elements is available
in figure~\ref{fig:IconExplanation}.

\paragraph{Game objective}
To complete a given level, the player must obtain the goal (``gold coin''),
return to the time machine and enter it.

\subsection{Player actions}
\label{player-actions}
Each turn, the player can do one of the following moves:

\begin{itemize}
\item Stand still (i.e. ``do nothing'')
\item Attempt to move to a neighbouring square (i.e. up, down, left or right)
\item Enter time machine (only allowed on top of the time-machine)
\end{itemize}

The player can push a crate by moving ``into'' it provided that the
destination for the crate is available.  It is not possible to
``pull'' crates and the player can push at most one crate.  These
are basically the same rules used in Sokoban for moving crates.

Any number of ``player selves'' are allowed to occupy the same
tile.

\paragraph{Time jumping}
\label{time-jumping}
The player has the ability to go back in time to the first turn.  As
the player goes back in time, the world will reset itself to its
initial state, but with one crucial difference.

There is now an extra ``player'' in the level; namely the ``current
self'' that performed the time jump and the ``past self/selves''.  The
latter will carry out their actions (as the player did in that time
jump) and eventually enter the time machine.

All ``selves'' are identically in terms of play rules (e.g. any of
them can pick up the goal).  Particularly, all ``selves'' must
eventually enter the time machine.  The only difference is that the
player actively controls the ``current self''.

Time jumping allows the player to do things that would not otherwise
be possible by playing ``ping-poing'' with his/her ``past selves'',
though at the risk of introducing temporal paradoxes (see
\nameref{temporal-paradox}).

\subsubsection{Field states and manipulation}
\label{field-states}
Certain fields in the game world have multiple states with different
behaviour.  State changes are generally triggered by the actions of
the player.  The following fields can change during the play:

\begin{itemize}
\item Pressure plate (button)
\item ``One-time button''
\item Gate
\item ``One-time pass''
\end{itemize}

The gates start as either ``open'' (passable) or ``closed''
(impassable).  They alter state when a button activate them.  If
multiple buttons activate the same gate, then its resulting state
depends on the number of gates.  If the number is 0 or ``even'', the
gate is in its starting state and if the number is odd it is in the
``opposite'' state\footnote{Basically a ``boolean xor'' for those
  familiar with that term}.

All buttons are activated when a player or crate is on top of them.
The difference between a ``one-time button'' and a pressure plate is
that an activated pressure plate will deactivate when nothing is on
top of it (like a ``dead man's switch'').  A ``one-time button'' can,
once pressed, never be ``unpressed''.

A ``one-time pass'' (short for ``one-time passage'') is a field that
(as the name suggests) can only be passed once.  The passage will
``collapse'' on the turn after a player or crate enters it.  From a
semantic point of view, the field turns into a wall.  The net effect
is that a player cannot linger on the field and crates cannot be pushed
on to the field\footnote{Because there is no way to push it off the field
and it is not allowed to stay on the field either}.

As the keen reader may already have guessed (or noticed), ``one-time''
is defined as ``once per time jump'' and not ``once per level''.  When
performing a time jump, these fields are still reset to their initial
state.  (See \nameref{time-jumping})

\subsubsection{Losing}

There are three different ways of losing
\footnote{Implementation Detail: The game calls all cases for a ``Time paradox''.}.

\paragraph{Getting stuck}
If a ``player self'' gets stuck and is unable to return to start, it
is not possible to win.  If the player gets stuck in a closed gate or
a crate, the game will automatically mark the game as lost.

If the player simply manages to ``lock himself/herself into a corner''
with no path back to start, the game will still continue (despite being
unsolvable) until the player restarts/gives up.

\paragraph{Temporal paradox}
\label{temporal-paradox}
As the name suggests, a temporal paradox (``time paradox'') is a bad
thing.  What happens if your current self prevent your past self from
becoming the current self?  In this game, you simply lose.

\paragraph{Non-Determinism}
All valid actions are carried out ``simultaneously''.  If one (or
more) valid action(s) causes another valid action to fail, the result
is non-deterministic.

As an example, consider if two clones attempt to push the same
crate.  This gives 3 cases, of which one is non-deterministic.

\begin{itemize}
\item Both clones pushes it in the same direction (i.e. they perform
  the same action and start on the same field), the actions are
  deterministic and will be carried out.
\item Both clones pushes it in opposite directions.  In this case,
  both actions are ``invalid'' because each clone can conclude (before
  pushing) that the move will not work.  This is deterministic and
  result in none of the clones moving.
\item The clones pushes it in ortogonal directions.  This causes
  non-determinism as each clone believe the action is valid, but
  both actions cannot be carried out.
\end{itemize}

This rule is (also) a generalization of getting stuck in a gate or
crate.

\subsubsection{Scoring}
The player is scored on the number of moves performed and the number
of time jumps used.  For comparsion, the lowest score is considered
best (i.e. most efficient).  The scoring rules are:

\begin{itemize}
\item 1 point per move or skipped turn by the ``current self''.
  Entering the time machine counts as a move.
\item 1 point per skipped turn while the ``current self'' is outside
  the time machine.  0 points if the ``current self'' is inside the
  time machine.
\item 1 point for every time jump performed.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Desired features}

\subsection{Technical challenges}
We had some major technical challenges.  Most of them turned out to be
easier to solve in practise than we thought originally.

The primary technical challenge was actually levels.  Finding a(n
optimal) solution to a Sokoban level is already known to be NP-Hard.
Adding a time machine and extra game mechanics on top of that is
unlikely to make it any easier to find an optimal solution.

We did not have any mechanically way of finding the solution to any of
our levels.  But more importantly, we had no way of verifying that the
solution we found is indeed the optimal one.  Especially, we have no
way of checking if our solution is (still) optimal if we change the
scoring rules.

Another perceived issue was detecting the losing criteria.  While it
turned out to be fairly easy in practise, we did spent quite some time
figuring out all the cases that could introduce non-determinism and
how to detect them.
